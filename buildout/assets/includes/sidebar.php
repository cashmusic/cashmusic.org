	<h2>The CASH Music Platform</h2>
	<p>
		We’re building a free and open platform that gives musicians and labels a no-programming environment for music tech online. You download it, the platform works with your website, integrates with what you’ve got, and will play nice with services like Amazon, PayPal, Twitter, MailChimp, and more.
